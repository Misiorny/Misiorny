## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris (nick Misiorny)  -  candidate of junior developer. 
I started my adventure with programming in 2021 and since then I have been learning how to do it in accordance with good coding practices.

I know well:
HTML, CSS, BEM, SASS / SCSS, JavaScript
I am still learning:
React, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, Redux
I plan to learn:
Python, Django, Jinja, cloud development.

I am actively looking to work in IT, despite the fact that I am already retired, because I have always dreamed of programming and making websites.

I am happy to take part in projects where I will be able to learn and gain my first commercial experience under the watchful eye of an experienced programmer

And dreams must come true.

Travel is my dream come true. I post reports from them on my blog (https://www.facebook.com/AfrykaDzikaMisiornego), and the effect of my learning is my first website (https://afrykadzika.pl/).
Technically terrible, but first self-written.

Please visit my repository.
