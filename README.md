## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris (Misiorny)  -  candidate of junior developer. 

I started my adventure with programming in 2021 and since then I have been learning how to do it in accordance with good coding practices.

### About me

Travel is my dream come true.
I post reports from them on [my blog](https://www.facebook.com/AfrykaDzikaMisiornego), and my [first website](https://misiorny.github.io/AfrykaDzika/index.html) the very firs effect of my learning.

Technically terrible, but self-written.

### What next ?

I am actively looking to work in IT, despite the fact that I am already retired, because I have always dreamed of programming and making websites.

I am happy to take part in projects where I will be able to learn and gain my first commercial experience under the watchful eye of an experienced programmer

And dreams must come true.
