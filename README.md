## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris (Misiorny)  -  candidate of junior developer. 

I started my adventure with programming in 2021 and since then I have been learning how to do it in accordance with good coding practices.

### About me

Travel is my dream come true.
I post reports from them on [my blog](https://www.facebook.com/AfrykaDzikaMisiornego), and my [first website](https://misiorny.github.io/AfrykaDzika/index.html) the very first effect of my learning.

Technically terrible, but self-written.

Another dream is coding/programming. I have been start learning basic of frontend in second half of 2021. 
When I finished my first course I decided to know more about JavaScript enviroment. For better knowledge and understanding  I pass courses like below: 
--[MMCSchool](https://mmcschool.pl/),
--[SzkoÅ‚a Reacta](https://szkolareacta.pl/).

As support for my skils I made some courses from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

Now, I'm still learning on course [Nowoczesny Frontend](https://hyperfunctor.com/nextjs-react-graphql-typescript). 

After over one and half years of lerning I know what skills I have to improve. Not like Noob Dev - I will learn all what I will find in Google :) 


### What next ?

I am actively looking to work in IT, despite the fact that I am already retired, because I have always dreamed of programming and making websites.

I am happy to take part in projects where I will be able to learn and gain my first commercial experience under the watchful eye of an experienced programmer

And dreams must come true.
