## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris (Misiorny)  -  junior developer. 

I started my adventure with programming in 2021 and since then I have been learning how to do it in accordance with good coding practices.

### My skills

|SASS/SCSS|TypeScript|
|Git|Node|
|GitHub|Next|


### About me

Travel is my dream come true.
I post reports from them on [my blog](https://www.facebook.com/AfrykaDzikaMisiornego), and my [first website](https://misiorny.github.io/AfrykaDzika/index.html) the very first effect of my learning.

Technically terrible, but self-written.

Another dream is coding/programming.  
When I finished my first course I decided to know more about JavaScript enviroment. For better knowledge and understanding I passed courses like below: 
* [MMCSchool](https://mmcschool.pl/),
* [SzkoÅ‚a Reacta](https://szkolareacta.pl/).

As support for my skils I made some courses from platform [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

Now, I'm still learning on course [Nowoczesny Frontend](https://hyperfunctor.com/nextjs-react-graphql-typescript). 

After over one and half years of learning I know what skills I have to know. Not like Noob Dev - I will learning all what I will find in Google. 


### What next ?

I am actively looking to work in IT. 
I am happy to take part in projects where I will be able to learn and gain my first commercial experience under the watchful eye of an experienced programmer

And dreams must come true.
